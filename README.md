# Sudoku Solver

C# implementation of a sudoku solver using candidate checking and backtracking (depth-first search/bruteforce) strategies to solve sudokus. Can easily be extended with other solving strategies.

Set the "ManualInput" attribute in Program.cs to control whether to input a sudoku manually or to solve one of the predefined sudokus.
```
private const bool ManualInput = true; //false
```

Predefined sudokus are located in Maps.cs
